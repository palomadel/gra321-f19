    <h1>Dining Guide: Best Restaurants on Lower Mill Avenue in Tempe</h1>
    <h2>King Coffee</h2>
    <h3>1020 South Mill Avenue, Tempe</h3>
        <p>King Coffee is a Tempe-area shop with that special, indescribable something. The shop has all the hallmarks of a casual, college-town cafe and doesn’t slack when it comes to quality. King Coffee’s staff do a great job with beans from local roaster Cortez Coffee. And as if that wasn’t enough, they are always warm and welcoming — you won’t find any disaffected, grumbly college baristas at this shop.</p>
    <h2>U.S. Egg</h2>
    <h3>131 East Baseline Road, Tempe</h3>
        <p>This quintessential Phoenix-area breakfast has been around since 1986. U.S. Egg is known for serving eggs every old which-a-way, topping off your coffee, and some specialty dishes like chicken and waffles. In addition, you'll find a variety of sandwiches, salads, and some morning cocktails.</p>
    <h2>Bao Chow at Yucca Tap Room</h2>
    <h3>29 West Southern Avenue, Tempe</h3>
        <p>Yucca Tap Room has been a stalwart live music venue in Tempe area since the 1970s. It doubles as a good place to drink. You can hit the Yucca for a Baileys as early as 6 a.m. We recommended the breakfast at Bao Chow, too, including the Slutty Burrito and the I Hate Myself and Want To Die breakfast platter. This spot happens to be the official Arsenal football club pub in metro Phoenix, so you can anticipate a rowdy group of soccer fans in the early hours.</p>
    <h2>Bosa Donuts</h2>
    <h3>37 West Baseline Road, Tempe</h3>
        <p>Just need a quick coffee and doughnut? The Park Plaza at Mill Avenue and Baseline Road is home to a Bosa Donuts, one of the sites on the ever-growing list of locations in Arizona. Find plain and fancy doughnuts, breakfast sandwiches, croissants, muffins, and yes, hot coffee.</p>
